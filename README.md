# Springseed

Springseed is the simple and easy way to take your notes.

## Building this code.
Springseed is now based on the awesome work of the people at Github and as such we use the fantastic `atom-shell` framework to get stuff done. As such, we have introduced a new build systembased on the GNU Makefile build system.

    # The command below automatically runs npm, then builds Springseed
    make

After this, you can use our old build system to build the app part of it (for now)

    cake -w server

If you're feeling awesome, you should contribute either with code or a [donation](http://getspringseed.com/donate). Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/consindo/notes/issues) and tackle an issue.

Springseed is written in CoffeeScript and uses Spine.JS for MVC.
