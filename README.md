# Springseed

Springseed is the simple and easy way to take your notes.

## Building this code.
Springseed is now based on the awesome work of the people at Github and as such we use the fantastic `atom-shell` framework to get stuff done. As such, we have introduced a new build system based on the GNU Makefile build system. Should the build below fail, you should run `make clean` before trying again because some make operations won't complete if they've errored. Nothing we can do to fix this :).

    sudo gem install sass
    make

Springseed is written in CoffeeScript and uses Spine.JS for MVC.
